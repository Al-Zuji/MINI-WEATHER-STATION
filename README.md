To get started on your "MINI WEATHER STATION" project, let's break down the requirements and steps needed:

Hardware Setup

1. Raspberry Pi 4B:
   - Install Raspbian OS.
   - Ensure you have internet connectivity (either Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
2. DHT 11 Sensor:
   - Connect the DHT 11 sensor to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.
   - You may need a pull-up resistor (4.7k or 10k ohm) for stable readings.
3. Camera Module:
   - Attach the camera module to the CSI port on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Enable the camera interface in raspi-config.
4. 7-inch Screen:
   - Connect the Screen to the HDMI port of the Raspberry Pi.
   - Adjust the display settings in the Raspberry Pi configuration if necessary.
